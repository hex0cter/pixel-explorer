# How Screens Work - Interactive Educational Web App

This interactive web application provides a hands-on learning experience about the fundamental principles behind how screens display images and colors. It features three interactive tabs:

## 1. Pixel Zoom Adventure

Explore the concept of pixels by zooming in on an image to see its individual pixel components.
*   Upload your own images or use the default sample.
*   Adjust the zoom level to magnify the image and observe the pixel structure.
*   See how images are composed of tiny colored squares.

## 2. Color Creator Lab

Experiment with RGB color mixing to understand how screens generate a wide range of colors.
*   Use sliders to control the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue light.
*   Observe the resulting color as the RGB values change.
*   See how different combinations of RGB create different colors.

## 3. Resolution Explorer

Discover how the number of pixels (resolution) affects image quality.
*   Select from various preset resolutions (High, Medium, Low, Very Low).
*   Observe how the image becomes more pixelated as the resolution decreases.
*   Understand the relationship between resolution and image clarity.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
